My name is Liu, Xiao (柳瀟).
I was born in [ZhangYe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhangye) which is a small and beautiful city in Gansu Province, mainland China.
I spent 19 years at ZhangYe with my family untill I graduated from high school.
Then I came to [Pusan National University (PNU)](http://english.pusan.ac.kr/uPNU_homepage/en/default.asp) at Busan in South Korea in 2009.
During 2009 to 2010, I spent one year on studying Korean and applied Computer Science as my major for undergraduate at PNU.
I recieved my Bachelor of Engineering degree at 2014, then devoted myself to the master&PhD integrated program in the CS department of PNU. A master degree as a middle degree was given to me at 2019 and I got my PhD degree at Feb. 2022.
